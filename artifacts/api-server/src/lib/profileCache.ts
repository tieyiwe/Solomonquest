/**
 * requireAuth runs on nearly every authenticated API request in the app and

 * most requests into a pure in-memory hit instead of a DB round-trip, while
 * still bounding staleness to a few seconds if it does change (and callers
 * that change it explicitly invalidate below, so that path is immediate).
